# Debugging Teams by Brian Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman

A guide to building effective teams of creative makers. It is aimed primarily at individual contributors on software engineering teams. This book is ideal for senior or intermediate+ engineers who want a high-level introduction to the non-technical aspects of building and shipping software. It includes interesting and compelling stories to illustrate and solidify the ideas. A nice "intro to leadership" for individual contributors.

## Chpater 1: The Myth of the Genius Programmer

* Notes a culture of insecurity among developers and argues that this is harmful. "Programming is a team sport."
* Introduces and defines the "three pillars" of effective human interaction: humility, respect, and trust. HRT pronounced "heart"

## Chapter 2: Building an Awesome Team Culture

* How to build a successful team
* The goal is to make the team culture self selecting: elements that do not fit the culture will be eliminated automatically by the culture itself. The team will not waste effort on fighting "poisonous" cultural elements
* Talks about what a good culture is and how to achieve it
* Essentially, the recommendations all apply the HRT pillars to different aspects of team communication (when, how, why communication occurs, etc.)

## Chapter 3: Every Boat Needs a Captain

* Fundamentals of leading a productive team
* Directed primarily at ICs who lead; not at managers
* Contrasts "leading" a team with "managing" a team
* Discusses how, officially or unofficially, an IC ends up in a leadership position. Touches on the benefits and challenges of leadership
* Provides lists of antipatterns and patterns for successful leadership
* Great content here. Lots of stories and analogies

## Chapter 4: Dealing with Poisonous People

* Defines "poisonous people" as referring to _behaviours_ and not actually people. They are the behaviours that suck energy from you team and make it less productive
* Eliminate the behaviours; not the people
* Reviews the principles from Chapter 2: this is how you "fortify" your team against poisonous behaviours
* Provides lists of common poisonous behaviours and techniques for dealing with poisonous behaviours
* The ideas are rooted in the HRT pillars

## Chapter 5: The Art of Organizational Manipulation

* Describes how things would work in an ideal company and acknowledges that no company is ideal
* Describes some personalities and traits that make a company non-ideal. This is a good reference when you feel a dysfunction, but can't put your finger on the root cause
* Gives an excellent list of techniques for being effective in a non-ideal organization
* Proposes changing jobs as a last resort. Often being aware that there are other lets you feel less pressure, get more done, and be more effective in your current role

## Chapter 6: Users are People Too

* As engineers we often forget that we are building products for _users_ not for ourselves
* This chapter reminds us that the users should be our primary focus
* It discusses the interactions between users and a product and between users and the company that builds the product
* They boil it down into three categories: marketing, product design, and customer service
