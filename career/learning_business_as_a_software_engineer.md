### Aswath Damadoran's Courses

[Link to his web site](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/). [Link to his course materials and online lectures](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/regularclass.htm).

Teaches online course on valuation and corporate finance. Seems like an excellent lecturer. Undergraduate corporate finance course looks quite good. Seems to assume some background e.g. accounting.

28 sessions, 1.5 hours each = 42 hours plus projects and quizzes.
Lectures and course materials available free online.

### How to Use Financial Statements: A Guide to Understanding the Numbers Book

Book by James Bandler. Appears to focuses more on on financial statements than business or finance. It is a quick read at about 130 pages. Quoting from the [Amazon description](https://www.amazon.ca/How-Use-Financial-Statements-Understanding/dp/078630197X), this book covers:

* An overview of financial statements, what they are, and what they tell us
* A thorough, yet basic introduction to the accrual
* Easy to understand explanations of profit and loss
* Statement of cash flows and special reporting issues

### Financial Intelligence, Revised Edition: A Manager's Guide to Knowing What the Numbers Really Mean Book

Book by Berman and Knight. [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00AXS5EAK/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). From the table of contents, it covers income statements, balance sheets, cash, ratios, ROI. Receives good reviews on Amazon. 300 pages.

### The Personal MBA

Book by Kaufman. [Link](https://personalmba.com/). Another highly reviewed book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08H5PKGGG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). This book is about business, and not specifically finance. It covers "the essentials of every major business topic" ([ref](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08H5PKGGG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)). 450 pages.

### Leger CLI Documentation

[Link](https://www.ledger-cli.org/). Leger CLI is a command line accounting tool with [extensive documentation](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html). On poster notes that they learned accounting basics simply by reading the documentation to learn the tool. It looks like an interesting tool and is worth further investigation.

### Google "DIY MBA" for Recommended Reading Lists

One recommendation was a web search for "DIY MBA." This produced a promising-looking [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/663vkv/diymba_a_compiled_list_of_19_free_courses_31_books/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but the [linked site](www.skipmba.com/diy-mba-reading-list/) times out when I try to load it. An archive copy of the content is available on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20200217114735/http://www.skipmba.com/diy-mba-reading-list/).
